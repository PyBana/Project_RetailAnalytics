# Sales Analytics

Introduction

In this project, I delved into sales data from a toy company, employing Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning and manipulation. By condensing the dataset, I made it more manageable for analysis, focusing on key metrics like sales per year, best-selling quarters, and overall trends. Additionally, I examined countries with the most unique clients and identified correlations between products and countries. Notably, I uncovered potential price discrimination strategies, shedding light on market dynamics. Matplotlib and Seaborn aided visualization, offering clarity through tools like FacetGrid. This comprehensive approach, blending internal performance analysis with external market observations, guides informed decision-making for business growth and customer satisfaction.
